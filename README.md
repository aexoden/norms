`norms` is both a set of guidelines and standards for programming projects as
well as a tool to help implement and enforce them.

At this time, it is a highly opinionated tool primarily intended to help me
standardize the tooling on my various projects. It is also experimental, in that
I have not yet determined the final standards for my projects.
